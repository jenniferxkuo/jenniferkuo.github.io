I am a 5th year PhD student in the Linguistics department at UCLA. I am primarily interested in the structure of paradigms. My recent work in particular involves looking at paradigm reanalysis, and how cognitive biases and frequency-matching interact to influence the direction of reanalysis. Languages I have worked on include Seediq, Malagasy, Maori, and Yongning Na.
