I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell University. 

I am primarily interested in how morphophonological paradigms are learned. I look at how paradigm learning is affected by different cognitive biases, and how statistical learning interacts with such biases. I address this question using experiments (wug tests, artificial grammar learning), comparative data on language change over time, and quantitative modeling.

My dissertation, titled <i>Phonological markedness effects in paradigm reanalysis</i>, looks at the interaction of frequency-matching with markedness-avoidance in Malagasy, Samoan, and Māori. Details can be found [here](/publications/2023-phd-dissertation).

My empirical focus is on Austronesian languages. Languages I have worked on include Seediq (Atayalic), Malagasy (Malayo-Polynesian), Māori (Malay-Polynesian), and Yongning Na (Sino-Tibetan).
