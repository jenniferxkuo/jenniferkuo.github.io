I am a 5th year PhD student in the Linguistics department at UCLA.

I am primarily interested in the structure of paradigms, and how different learning biases affect the learning of paradigms. I address this question by looking at paradigm reanalysis over time, and how markedness effects and frequency-matching interact to influence the direction of reanalysis. In more recent work, I am supplementing these findings with experimental evidence from Artificial Grammar Learning experiments.

This year, I am working on my dissertation, titled <i>Markedness effects in paradigm reanalysis</i>. Details on my preliminary findings for Malagasy can be found [here](/publications/2022-mlg-manuscript).

Languages I have worked on include Seediq, Malagasy, MaÌ„ori, and Yongning Na.
