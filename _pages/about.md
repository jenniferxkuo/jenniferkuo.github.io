I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell University. 

I am primarily interested in the structure of paradigms, and how different learning biases affect the learning of paradigms. I address this question by looking at paradigm reanalysis over time, and how markedness effects and frequency-matching interact to influence the direction of reanalysis. In more recent work, I am supplementing these findings with experimental evidence from Artificial Grammar Learning experiments.

My dissertation, titled <i>Phonological markedness effects in paradigm reanalysis</i>, looks at the interaction of frequency-matching with markedness-avoidance in Malagasy, Samoan, and Māori. Details can be found [here](/publications/2023-phd-dissertation).

Languages I have worked on include Seediq, Malagasy, Māori, and Yongning Na.
