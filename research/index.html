				<p>I am working with <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~jstanford/">James Stanford</a> at Dartmouth College and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=45OKAPAAAAAJ&hl=en">Cathryn Yang</a> at Yunnan Minzu University on sociolinguistic variation in Na (or Mosuo). Na is a rural language community with ~40,000 people, located mainly around Lugu Lake in Yunnan and Sichuan. The Na practice matrilineal inheritance with lifelong matrilocal residence. As such, variation in Na is of particular theoretical interest for examining Labov's classic gender principles of sound change (e.g., Labov 1966, 2001, Trudgill 1972, Wolfram 1969). </p>

				<p> Preliminary results, based on word-list reading from 48 speakers, suggests that consistent with Labovian principles, Na women are leading sound changes in tone and vowel quality.</p>
