abstract: 'Standard approaches to learning the morphophonology of paradigms require positing URs from which surface contrasts can be derived. Often, URs are &quot;cobbled&quot;, in that they combine information from multiple forms of the paradigm, and do not necessarily correspond to anysingle surface form (Kenstowicz and Kisseberth, 1977: 33). In contrast, Albright (2002, etseq.) argues for a single surface base approach,  where the UR must be based on the surface forms of one slot in the paradigm.  In Tgdaya Seediq (Austronesian: Taiwan),  all forms of a paradigm (non-suffixed vs.  suffixed) suffer from some loss of contrasts, making it a good test case for comparing between the two theories of morphophonology.  In this thesis, I conduct an empirical study of Seediq verbal alternations, and find support for Albrightâ€™s surface base hypothesis.'
