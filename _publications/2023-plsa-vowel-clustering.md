abstract: 'The K-means algorithm is the most commonly used clustering method for phonetic vowel description but has some properties that may be sub-optimal for rep- resenting phonetic data. This study compares K-means with an alternative algorithm, OPTICS, in two speech styles (lab vs. conversational) in English to test whether OP- TICS is a viable alternative to K-means for characterizing vowel spaces. We find that with noisier data, OPTICS identifies clusters that more accurately represent the un- derlying data. Our results highlight the importance of choosing an algorithm whose assumptions are in line with the phonetic data being considered.'
