abstract: 'Standard morphophonological analysis allows URs to &quot;cobble&quot; together information from multiple slots of a paradigm (Kenstowicz and Kisseberth, 1977). In contrast, under the single surface base hy- pothesis (Albright 2002 et seq.), the input to morphophonology must be a single slot in a paradigm. In this paper, I compare the two approaches by examining verb paradigms in Tgdaya Seediq. In a corpus study of the Seediq lexicon, I find that isolation stems are much more informative than suffixed forms in predicting other slots of the paradigm. This asymmetry is argued to support the surface-base approach. Corpus results are backed up a production experiment, where speakers productively extended alternations from the isolation stem. Interestingly, speakers over-generalised certain patterns instead of matching lexical statistics. Based on these results, I propose a surface-base model for Seediq alternations.'
